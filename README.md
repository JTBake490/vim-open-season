# Open-Season

My personal normal mode remappings to open files (and directories) by yanking them open.
I never intend to disable these keybindings; thus I have not setup a toggle.
These remapping took inspiration for from tpope's vim-commentary and vim-surround.

## Mappings

```
 Action                         Mappings
 
 open new tab                   yo<TAB>
 
 close tab                      yd<TAB>
 
 open new buffer (window)        yonw
 
 open new horizontal buffer      yonh
 
 open new vertical buffer        yonv
 
 open horizontal buffer (window) yohw
 
 open vertical buffer (window)   yovw
 
 close buffer                    ydb
 
 open vertical terminal         yot
 
 open netrw buffer               yoe
 
 open netrw vertical buffer      yove
```
